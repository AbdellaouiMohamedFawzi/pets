# pets

This is a pet adoption app using the backend server in the following link: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/.
you can see all the pets available with their attributes, edit pets and add a new pet.

## Getting Started

1. Configure the REST client : 
    In the api_service.dart file, I have included all the HTTP request methods such as getAllPets to get all the pets in the database, putPet to edit a pet, and postPet to add a new pet to the database.
2. Define the Models : 
    In the model's folder, I have included all the models and attributes such as the pet, category, and tag with their methods and constructors.
3- Develop the UI :
    In the UI folder, I have developed UI designs for the three pages. The all_pets.dart is the page responsible for listing all pets.
    The add_pet.dart is the page responsible for adding a new pet.
    The edit_pet.dart is the page responsible for editing a pet.
